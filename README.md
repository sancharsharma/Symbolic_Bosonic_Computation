This is a code that can symbolically manipulate rational functions (sums of ratios of polynomials) containing bosonic operators. A well written tutorial and a detailed readme file will follow soon. For now, try the file 'CodeExplained.pdf' for basic explanations. For understanding the code, start with 'Testing.py' to test out the code for your favourite bosonic functions and trace back the functions used therein to 'Simps_Boson.py' and 'Bosons.py'.
